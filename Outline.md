- CLI app with the UI similar to eg Taproom app
- Purpose: manage the context within all Claude.md / Memory / configuration
- First approc. feature:
	- Ability to give an path (one or more) 
	- Within this path recursive search finds all CLAUDE.md files
	- In UI narrow left panel shows a tree of CLAUDE.md path 
		- UI is navigable by arrow keys
	- in the broad right panel content of selected CLAUDE.md file is visible
	- Inplace edit in any file is possible
		- quick navigate through rows
		- jumping words
		- edit
	- files is autosaved
- App should be easily recompile for linux
- Native for mac os
- Win11 not necessary
- More "visual" UI should be possible in the future
